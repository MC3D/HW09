Full of very unique fabrics that appear to be old patterns, sprinkled in there are some patchwork with darling Beagle dog Print fabric (See 3rd photo and zoom). The colors are still vibrant in the graphic patterns and they really pop when displayed on the bed. It appears to be either a Full Size and is shown on a Queen Size Bed. Please note it barely hangs off the sides of the queen bed so it is best suited for a smaller area. It has a reversible tan caramel cotton fabric on the back, that has a pattern that looks like eyelashes (see last photo of close up). There are a couple spots on the underside fabric and no holes or wear to that side. There are 2 quilt pieces with wear, the worst is shown in the 3rd photo, both are on the same side of the quilt. So it can be used hidden to the one side of view. It is visible that there is cotton batting, as seen in the main photo. The edges are finished in a red Calico Print fabric on all sides. There is authentic charm and age to this quilt. It is hand pieced throughout, including the hem. It is completely hand stitched. Very minimal wear to the edges. It feels like is it made with all cotton fabrics. The quilt measures 66&quot; x 83&quot;. It has zig zag  border on 2 sides sides, photo is available upon request of the edge. The quilt pieces measures 4 1\/2&quot; diameter.  It all looks very handmade but nicely assembled, not sloppy at all. It is &quot;signed&quot; with a separate piece of fabric stitched to it, see last photo. I can not make out the name. The fabric appears durable except for the 2 quilt pieces mentioned. This is a finished quilt. This has not been recently laundered. This could be used as is or upcycled, or used as a wall hanging or old iron bed in the cabin. It has a nice weight to it and weighs  5 lbs prior to packing materials. It is very pretty and has so much vintage charm. In Great Vintage condition considering. No funky odor.  It comes from a smoke free home. Please feel free to ask questions or for additional photos. ZOOM is available on all photos.\r\n\r\n~~US Shipping Rate is Standard Parcel Post and includes Insurance and Delivery Confirmation~~ Please note Standard Parcel Post can take up to 7 days transit.

The print is applied and sealed with a non-toxic, water-based sealer. Each wood block is stained with an eco-friendly mahogany finish and is signed on the back. The block can easily sit on a shelf or hang on a wall.\r\n\r\nAll wood block art prints are handmade in Chicago. Thank you for checking out my work.\r\n\r\n*****************************************************\r\nCheck out the rest of my shop! luciusart.etsy.com\r\n*****************************************************","creation_tsz":1410281946,"ending_tsz":1420826346,"original_creation_tsz":1300312257,"last_modified_tsz":1410281946,"price":"39.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["wood","beagle","dog","bike","bicycle","blue","funny","kids","vintage","old","photo","teal","beagle art"],"category_path":["Art","Print","Woodblock"],"category_path_ids":[68887312,68892154,68925976],"materials":["wood"],"shop_section_id":8143230,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1410103236,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/70184460\/beagle-art-print-beagle-riding-a-bicycle?utm_source=explorer&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":772,"num_favorers":26,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2014","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":417055130,"hex_code":"A6A394","red":166,"green":163,"blue":148,"hue":50,"saturation":10,"brightness":65,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1358440787,"listing_id":70184460,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/5986811\/il_75x75.417055130_s4ii.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/5986811\/il_170x135.417055130_s4ii.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/5986811\/il_570xN.417055130_s4ii.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/5986811\/il_fullxfull.417055130_s4ii.jpg","full_height":700,"full_width":700},{"listing_image_id":417060139,"hex_code":"989684","red":152,"green":150,"blue":132,"hue":54,"saturation":13,"brightness":59,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1358440787,"listing_id":70184460,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/5986811\/il_75x75.417060139_nzc8.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/5986811\/il_170x135.417060139_nzc8.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/5986811\/il_570xN.417060139_nzc8.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/5986811\/il_fullxfull.417060139_nzc8.jpg","full_height":700,"full_width":700},{"listing_image_id":417060165,"hex_code":"A0A28B","red":160,"green":162,"blue":139,"hue":65,"saturation":14,"brightness":63,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1358440787,"listing_id":70184460,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5986811\/il_75x75.417060165_2q8f.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5986811\/il_170x135.417060165_2q8f.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5986811\/il_570xN.417060165_2q8f.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/011\/0\/5986811\/il_fullxfull.417060165_2q8f.jpg","full_height":875,"full_width":700},{"listing_image_id":584194085,"hex_code":"776E6B","red":119,"green":110,"blue":107,"hue":15,"saturation":10,"brightness":46,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1396375721,"listing_id":70184460,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/027\/0\/5986811\/il_75x75.584194085_m2v5.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/027\/0\/5986811\/il_170x135.584194085_m2v5.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/027\/0\/5986811\/il_570xN.584194085_m2v5.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/027\/0\/5986811\/il_fullxfull.584194085_m2v5.jpg","full_height":900,"full_width":900}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5986811,"shop_name":"LuciusArt","user_id":10772081,"creation_tsz":1282013662,"title":"City Art,  Animal Art,  & Wood Block Art Prints","announcement":"City and State Art, Neighborhood Art, Crazy Animal Art, Wood Block Art Prints, Affordable Wall Art\r\n\r\nI am a graphic designer and artist from Chicago.
